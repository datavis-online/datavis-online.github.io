# Tutorial

<a name = "tutorial-fortyfive_ways"></a>
### Tutorial 1-1a: 45 Ways (20min)

1. Activity 1 (3min)
    * ***On your own***, using plain paper or a tablet, design as many different visualisations that you can think of to represent or communicate the two numbers provided.
    * Upload your designs to your group's Teams tutorial channel.
  
1. Discussion 1 (5min)  
    * ***Within your group***
    * Count:
        - unique designs
        - common designs
    * Discuss ideas/designs and reasoning behind them. Do you find common or diverging interpretation of the same design within your group?

1. Activity 2 (3min)
    * Based on additional context - meaning of numbers, repeat exercise ***as a group***.  
  You may draw on the whiteboard or share another drawing app from any participant's computer. Please save your design and upload to the [tutorial workspace](https://bit.ly/tutorial1-1a_sfcdv_jun2000). Note &mdash; if using the whiteboard maximise your screen and take a screen grab.

1. Discussion 2 (10-15min)
    * ***In the main classroom***
    * Discuss commonalities and variation between 2 sets of results (with and without context)
        - Why did ideas change? Or not?
    * What difference did working in groups make to your approach to design?
    * Why, when and how do context and domain knowledge/expertise influence visualisation design?
<p>&nbsp;</p>

### Tutorial1-1b: Visualisation Lies (1 hour)

1. Discussion 1 (~20min)
    * [Slides](https://bit.ly/tutorial1-1b)  
    
    * Communicating through distortion vs. Visualisation lies  
      e.g., [tube](http://content.tfl.gov.uk/standard-tube-map.pdf) & subway maps vs [overground walking maps](
https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/224813/response/560395/attach/3/London%20Connections%20Map.pdf)  
    * Misleading visualisations? Ambiguity?  
      e.g., [Stock vs flow diagrams](https://www.anderson.ucla.edu/faculty-and-research/anderson-review/stock-flows)  
    * Outright lies & distortion to convey message contrary to data content  
      e.g., [Explaining fuel price rises under India's PM Modi](https://thewire.in/economy/bjps-statistical-analysis-fuel-prices)

1. Activity 1 (30min)
    * ***Within your group***
    * Find one example each of:
        - a visualisation distorted to highlight a key message or more effectively convey information
        - a visualisation that distorts the underlying data or view to communicate a message not representative of the data content  
    Note: you may take examples from the lecture notes or any other source. Please make sure you correctly attribute the original visualisation.
    * What are the issues with each? What is the potential impact of acting on the information conveyed?
    * What, if any, are the benefits of each?
    * Is it possible to communicate the message intended without distorting data content or otherwise actively misleading?
        - if so, how would you redesign each to communicate the story intended or actual data content?
    
Upload your annotated, redesign sketches to the tutorial channel.

### Tutorial1-1c: Basic Charts

* This is an add-on exercise you may wish to try in your own time. We will cover similar exercises as part of other tutorials as the course progresses.
* The exercise uses data from National Records Scotland's 2019 population estimates<sup>[1](#ref-nrs-2019pop_estimates)</sup> and the time series<sup>[2](#ref-nrs-2019time_series)</sup> data.

1. Activity 1 (15min)
    * ***On your own or with a group***
    * Sketch (free-hand) up to 3 chart types for the datasets to show how you would use the data to illustrate:
        1. population change over the last century
        1. population distribution by age and/or sex in 2019
        1. population change by age group over the last 10 years
        1. the top and bottom 10% in population change by council area over the last year
        
1. Discussion (15min)
    * ***In the main classroom***
    * Discuss ideas (if on your own you may find it useful to reflect on these points)
        - Who is your target user? What influence did this have?
        - simple vs complex visualisations
        - coupled visualisations
<p>&nbsp;</p>
