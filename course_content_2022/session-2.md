### Tutorial 2-1: 45 Ways (20min)

1. Activity 1 (3min)
    * ***On your own***
    * Using plain paper or a tablet, design as many different visualisations that you can think of to represent or communicate the two numbers provided.
    * Upload your designs to your group's Teams tutorial channel.
1. Discussion 1 (5min)  
    * ***Within your group***
    * Count:
        - unique designs
        - common designs
    * Discuss ideas/designs and reasoning behind them. Do you find common or diverging interpretation of the same design within your group?
1. Activity 2 (3min)
    * ***As a group***
    * Based on additional context - the meaning of the numbers, repeat exercise.  
  You may draw on the whiteboard (in the Teams channel) or share another drawing app from any participant's computer.
1. Discussion 2 (10-15min)
    * ***In the main classroom***
    * Discuss commonalities and variation between 2 sets of results (with and without context)
        - Why did ideas change? Or not?
    * What difference did working in groups make to your approach to design?
    * Why, when and how do context and domain knowledge/expertise influence visualisation design?
<p>&nbsp;</p>

### Tutorial 2-2: Sketching (1h40mins)

Tutorial introduction [video on sketching](https://youtu.be/zaWquoSD_NQ) and [slides](files/2-Sketching.pdf).


1. Discussion 1 (30 min)
    * **In the main classroom** (10 min)
    * Quick review of project definition guidelines
    * Quick review of general design guidelines (from lecture material)
    <br/><br/>
    * **On your own** (10 min)
    * Draw four sketches:
        - today's weather
        - what comes to mind when you think of Scotland
        - this classroom
        - draw and annotate an idea of your own
    * Upload your sketches to your Teams tutorial channel
    <br/><br/>
    * **In the main classroom** (10 min)
    * What things do you need to look out for in your design sketches?
        - similarities? differences?
        - visualisation types? abstract? concrete?
        - use of black & white? vs. colour?
        - what ideas came up in freestyle drawing? 
            - does this approach liberate or constrain you in coming up with ideas?
    <br /><br />
1. Activity 1 (30 min) **On your own** <a name="general_guidelines"></a> &ndash; _General Guidelines_
    1. Go through your project definition and reflect on the key questions (~5 min)
        - What is the ___(Big) Question___?
        - What do you want to ___communicate___?
        - Who are you ___communicating___ it to?
        - What is the ___purpose___ of your visualisation?<br/>
    1. Based on your project definition and data think through potential solutions and sketch designs that illustrate these (~10 min)
        - for this initial exercise focus on what answers your question
            - do not restrict your design to what you already do or the skills you already possess
            - sketching allows you free reign to disentangle yourself from the restrictions of technology and skill/capability
        - the aim is to create sketches that communicate:
            * your design ideas to your intended target and other stakeholders
            * data content to your intended audience
                - you may use multiple sketches to explore different options
                - alternatively, you may have a single sketch broken down into sub-parts<br/>
    1. What are you communicating to your target users? (~15 min)
        - how are you communicating this?
        - does your design help your users to achieve their goals &mdash; the big question?
        - visualisation approach &ndash; how are you choosing to tell your story? e.g., using a data comic, one or more charts, infographic ...
        - what visualisation techniques will you include? standalone? coupled?
            - are you making use of visual metaphors? do they work for your target users and environment?
            - how will you present your design? structure vs. free flow? e.g., using a storyboard, a mind map, a flow chart, post-its on a board?
        - overview vs. detail, balance between complexity and sufficiency &ndash; remember the data-ink ratio
        - what pre-knowledge do you expect your users to feed into interpreting your visualisation?
        - layout and flow
            - how will users navigate through your solution?
            - where do they start? what support do you provide to help them discover the information they seek?
            - have you provided guides to help them correctly interpret the visualisation and confirm understanding (may include redundant encoding, legends, labelled axes, annotation)
        - aesthetics
            - visual appeal important but not a substitute for clear communication
            - colour palettes, use of patterns
        - static vs. interactive visualisation?
            - is your data dynamic?
            - do you need to visualise change or difference between data elements?
            - are you providing multiple layers?
        - do your users need to extract the underlying data? or summaries?
        - on-screen only? printable? mobile-friendly?   
__NOTE: no need to share sensitive data, especially when making annotations - your design need not be this specific__<br /><br />
1. Discussion 2 (15 min)
    * ***Within your groups***
    * Discuss your design ideas (choose 1 key area each and allow the opportunity for each person to share their ideas)
    * Solicit and give feedback
    * Nominate one idea or set of related ideas to discuss in class<br /><br />
1. Activity 2 (15 min)
    * ***On your own***
    * Reflect on general discussion and more specific feedback
         - update your initial ideas as desired
    * Now consider more practical considerations that may impact what of your design you can deliver now
        * do you have the data to build on your design?
            - what additional data processing may be necessary?
            - what additional domain knowledge will you need? do you have access to the experts required?
        * what additional skills will you need to develop?
        * note any practical constraints you envisage, e.g., (course) length and other resources needed to build solution, including technical skills, target user context and capability -
            - what are the key elements you want to focus on for implementation - what is often described as the MVP (minimum viable product)?
            - what can be set as future work, that will further enhance your initial delivery?<br /><br />
1. Discussion 3 (10 min)
    * **In the main classroom**
    - Round table discussion
    - General class feedback
    - Brief summary of reflection exercise, submission requirements and due date (Jun 12th)
   <br />    

___Before submission &ndash; reflect on your design choices by revisiting the [guidelines](#general-guidelines) for this exercise___
