## Final Project

### Guidance

* Project submission in **single** PDF
* 500 words summary \+ appendices \+ possible Video, URL, etc.
* Graded against below rubric

### Rubric

* Scenario Description: _What and whom are you designing for? What are your data?_
    * Unacceptable: No clearly defined audience. Unrealistic/absent data source
    * Pass: Clearly-defined audience. Data well-described and attained (or realistically attainable).
    * Exceptional: Well-communicated and clear audience described by e.g. personas, statistics or similar profiling. Data wholly described, present and well-prepared for use.
* Design Justification: _Why were these design choices made?_
    * Unacceptable: Perhaps some good design decisions made, but no transparency on why. Distinct lack of justification for any questionable design decisions. Design may be misleading/deceptive, without proper mitigation.
    * Pass: Sufficient justification of any important design decision that relates to scenario; such as visualization techniques, coloring, labeling, information, storytelling genre (if any), interactivity etc.
    * Exceptional: Clear justification and excellent communication of design process. Presentation of rule-breaking or non-traditional decisions explained through well-defined and nuanced argument, indicating exceptional understanding and communication.
* Clarity, Quality \& Creativity of Final Visualization: _Is the implemented artefact faithful to the design, well-executed, and creative?_
    * Unacceptable: Final visualization not present, unrelated to design process, or does not surpass sketching submission.
    * Pass: A visualization artefact faithful to designer goals, allowing user insight through good visualization technique and clear communication.
    * Exceptional: A visualization artefact achieving a wide range of design goals, with superior e.g. technological, narrative, or presentation qualities. Submission demonstrates engagement outside and beyond the course content.
