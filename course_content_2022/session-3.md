# Tutorial: Tool Marketplace 

__This tutorial explores the <a href="https://vistools.net">VisBrowser</a> as part of a wider tool discussion__

1. Discussion 1 (20 mins)
  * ***Within your groups***
  * Which visualisation tools do you know and have you used? 
  * Which tools does the VisBrowser contain:
    * that you have used before?
    * that are new to you but map to your experience &ndash; technique type, visualisation approach, design, etc.
  * What do you see as the most positive things vs. cons in tools you use now or have used in the past? 
  * Can you think of a tool you think should be listed in the VisBrowser that isn't?
    * please add an entry for it (to avoid duplication designate one scribe per group)
    * include a review to the tool you have experience with. Everyone in the group who has experience of the tool may submit an independent review and rating
    * link to any good tutorials for the tools you add or others you look at that you have used or have been recommended. 
  * Prepare a brief presentation (3min &ndash; tool matrix + 1 slide listing pros vs cons) 
  * Nominate 1 or 2 people to discuss your selected tool  with 'novices'.

  * ***Within your chosen interest groups***
  * try out tools and resources that match your interests and/or learning goals

      * does the VisBrowser's results match your requirements?  
  * how useful are the learning resources, if any, available for your choices?
  * how do you typically learn how to use a new tool? 
<br /><br />
4. Discussion 4 (5-10 mins)
