# Tutorial

<a name="tutorial-real-life"></a>
### Tutorial 1-1: Examples of Data Visualisation in Real Life (15 mins)

<a name = "tutorial-vis-lies"></a>
### Tutorial 1-2: Visualisation Lies (1 hour)

1. Discussion 1 (~20min)
    * [Slides](https://bit.ly/tutorial1-1b)  
    
    * Communicating through distortion vs. Visualisation lies  
      e.g., [tube](http://content.tfl.gov.uk/standard-tube-map.pdf) & subway maps vs [overground walking maps](
https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/224813/response/560395/attach/3/London%20Connections%20Map.pdf)  
    * Misleading visualisations? Ambiguity?  
      e.g., [Stock vs flow diagrams](https://www.anderson.ucla.edu/faculty-and-research/anderson-review/stock-flows)  
    * Outright lies & distortion to convey message contrary to data content  
      e.g., [Explaining fuel price rises under India's PM Modi](https://thewire.in/economy/bjps-statistical-analysis-fuel-prices)

1. Activity 1 (30min)
    * ***Within your group***
    * Find one example each of:
        - a visualisation distorted to highlight a key message or more effectively convey information
        - a visualisation that distorts the underlying data or view to communicate a message not representative of the data content  
    Note: you may take examples from the lecture notes or any other source. Please make sure you correctly attribute the original visualisation.
    * What are the issues with each? What is the potential impact of acting on the information conveyed?
    * What, if any, are the benefits of each?
    * Is it possible to communicate the message intended without distorting data content or otherwise actively misleading?
        - if so, how would you redesign each to communicate the story intended or actual data content?
    
Upload your annotated, redesign sketches to the tutorial channel.

<a name="tutorial-project-brief"></a>  
### Tutorial 1-3: (Formulating) visualisation brief (45 mins)
This tutorial forms the basis for [assignment 1](session-2.md#assignment), due May 29th.

 1. Activity 1 (10min)
     * ***On your own*** &ndash; think about
     - What is the (Big) Question?
     - What do you Want to Communicate?
     - Who are you Communicating it to?
     - What is the Purpose of your Visualisation?  
 Note: the [guidelines](#guidelines_defining_project_brief) below may be useful in helping you reflect on what must go into your brief. 

 1. Discussion 1 (15min)
     * ***In the main classroom***
     - review initial ideas based on guidelines
     - challenges / constraints
     - innovative ideas
     - volunteers to present their ideas OR use class example

 1. Reflection exercise 1 (10min)
     * ***On your own (if you've sensitive data) or within your groups***
     - review your initial ideas
     - update your brief  
 Note: reflection / discussions may be based around data type, task types, target users, norms in sectors/domains, innovation in task and/or solution(s) proposed, options for evaluating a solution.

 1. Discussion 2 (10min)
     * ***In the main classroom***
     - questions?
     - constraints or challenges recognised?
     - brief summary of reflection exercise and submission date
 <p>&nbsp;</p>


<a name="guidelines_defining_project_brief"></a>  
### General guidelines for defining brief

 1. **Task / Challenge / Issue**
     * exploring data to find ???
     * answering specific questions, e.g., for decision-making, strategy formulation
     * confirming a hypothesis, e.g., customers prefer X feature / brand
     * reporting - informing about X, e.g., growth against customer demographics
     * telling a story - similar to reporting, but may have a more general audience
     * other?

 1. **Target users**
     * yourself
     * your team
     * internal users, e.g., senior management, the wider organisation
     * external users, e.g., current and potential customers
     * the general public
     * ***user characteristics***
         - technical vs. non-technical
         - (varying degrees of) domain / task knowledge?
             - domain expert / specialist vs. non-specialist  
         - big picture (high-level overview) vs. detail
         - time-conscious or pressured?

 1. **Presentation format &amp; end use**
    * e.g., as a report, presentation, other static or interactive visualisation
    * context of use &ndash; within a specific sector / domain; influence of culture, knowledge

 1. **Data** 
     - size
     - format / storage type, e.g., plain text files, formatted reports, images, spreadsheets, remote database
     - complexity, e.g., multi-dimensional, text and numbers, disconnected / siloed data
     - static vs. dynamic?
     - own data vs. "external"? 
         * what is core? what will improve on visualisation, communication and exploration of content? any restrictions due to ownership, validity, privacy or commercial or other sensitivity?
         * costs associated with data preparation (resources, skill, time)

 1. **Developer data skills / capability**
     - what skills do you have?
     - what skills do you want to learn / apply?

 1. **Constraints**
     - time
     - data
     - skills (you and your target users)
     - domain and cultural norms
     - target environment, including technology available
     - who else are you reliant on, e.g., for domain or task knowledge, data, access to technology, access to target users?
     - other?


 **Note:**  
 1. no mention here of visualisation type or approach - this comes later. For now, think about what you want to do, not how.
 1. visualisation projects require user- and task-centred design
     - place your user(s) and task(s) at the centre of your project definition
     - you will iterate n (n >> 1) times before you finally deliver your specification, design and project
     - this may include more work on data acquisition and preparation
     - someone will ultimately evaluate your solution - does it meet your specification?
         * if you don't your users (still) will!
         * how will you evaluate your solution? what will you need to measure usability and utility for intended users, tasks and the environment in which it will be used?
