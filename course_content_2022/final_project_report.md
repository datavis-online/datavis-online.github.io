# Final Project

Your Final Project submission should consist of two components: a ***project report***, and ***four appendices***.

The [Project Report](#project-report) is a reflection on the visualisation process, and how you employed your project as a learning tool, to increase your visual literacy and acquire new, practical visualisation skills.

The [Appendices](#appendices) describe the design and implementation process.

Your report and all appendices __must be submitted as a single file__. Do NOT submit your project report as a collection of files, collate them into a single file or site.

The Final Project Submission will be marked according to the [Marking Rubric](#marking--rubric).

## Project Report

* __Report length__
    * __no more than 500 words, and must fit on a single side of A4 paper__
        * keep descriptions brief and to the point; ideally, use bullet points
* __Report Content__
    * your big question / challenge - one sentence or a couple of bullet points 
    * your (key/primary) target users (and environment if applicable)
      * _ensure the final version of your brief is detailed in an appendix_    
   * annotated design sketches
        * highlight which ideas you kept, which you rejected, and why. Justify your decisions using concepts from the lectures, any additional research and feedback from instructors
      * _ensure your final design is detailed in an appendix_     
    * impact of tool exploration and review, critical analysis, peer feedback and evaluation on original brief and initial design  
    * overall, reflect on the new skills you gained (techniques, tools, process) and how these fed into your delivery; you may present this as a comparison of your initial learning goals against the skills you actually gained
    * summary of future plan, indicating extensibility and reusability, and taking into account practical constraints
         * _if needed provide further detail as part of journal appendix_
    * __Acknowledge all people, organisations (e.g., data owners, end users) and data sources that fed into your work__

### Writing Guidance

* __In writing your report, reflect on:__
    * the process you followed
        * how a focus on visualisation as a tool for thinking, exploration and presentation impacted your workflow and outcomes
    * how you chose to communicate your ideas through the design process
    * the insights you discovered through iteration and evaluation, any challenges you encountered and steps you took to resolve those
    * what you will take away from this course and what you would do differently if you repeated it or took a similar course

## Appendices
<a name = "appendices"></a>

The report should be immediately followed by these _four_ critical appendices:

1. __Implementation__
    * one of the following, set up to use your intended delivery method (or as close to this as you can simulate):
        * a link to a website or other online space containing your solution (ensure this works in any modern, standard web browser)
        * a single file (ideally as PDF or other non-editable format) containing of a static solution, e.g., as a report, slideshow, mini booklet, data comic, infographic or any other format that demonstrates your solution
1. __Snapshots &ndash; Overview + Detail__
    * 3-5 annotated snapshots showing key elements
    * Ensure at least one snapshot shows an overview/start page of your visualisation
    * Consider detailing:
        1. sequence illustrating how a user would step through your solution
        1. detail or a key insight derived through interaction
    * Alternatively, record a video (of up to 90s) illustrating the above.
1. __Data__ 
    * description of your data and source/owner
        * metadata/simple description of data content and structure (e.g., "_csv file containing 100 lines with 5 columns describing age, height ..., linked to secondary source ..._")
    * summary of the data exploration and pre-processing phase
        * how you moved from source to the version you fed into your visualisation, including tools or methods
        * consider providing data snapshots to illustrate source to post processing (e.g., first, or random, three lines of a csv file highlighting key attributes/columns)
            * NOTE: mask/anonymise snapshot if necessary
1. __Journal__
    * document or outlining the process you followed
    * you decide how to present this, but it should show, e.g., "...initial brief delivered, update to brief based on EDA, change in dataset due to X..."
    * more detail if needed on your plan for future work

## Marking & Rubric

### Guidance

* Project report submission in **single** PDF
* 500 words summary \+ appendices \+ possible Video, URL, etc.
* Graded against below rubric

### Rubric

* Scenario Description: _What and whom are you designing for? What are your data?_
    * Unacceptable: No clearly defined audience. Unrealistic/absent data source
    * Pass: Clearly-defined audience. Data well-described and attained (or realistically attainable).
    * Exceptional: Well-communicated and clear audience described by e.g. personas, statistics or similar profiling. Data wholly described, present and well-prepared for use.
* Design Justification: _Why were these design choices made?_
    * Unacceptable: Perhaps some good design decisions made, but no transparency on why. Distinct lack of justification for any questionable design decisions. Design may be misleading/deceptive, without proper mitigation.
    * Pass: Sufficient justification of any important design decision that relates to scenario; such as visualization techniques, coloring, labeling, information, storytelling genre (if any), interactivity etc.
    * Exceptional: Clear justification and excellent communication of design process. Presentation of rule-breaking or non-traditional decisions explained through well-defined and nuanced argument, indicating exceptional understanding and communication.
* Clarity, Quality & Creativity of Final Visualization: _Is the implemented artefact faithful to the design, well-executed, and creative?_
    * Unacceptable: Final visualization not present, unrelated to design process, or does not surpass sketching submission.
    * Pass: A visualization artefact faithful to designer goals, allowing user insight through good visualization technique and clear communication.
    * Exceptional: A visualization artefact achieving a wide range of design goals, with superior e.g. technological, narrative, or presentation qualities. Submission demonstrates engagement outside and beyond the course content.
