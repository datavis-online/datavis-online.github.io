# Project Report

Your project report is a reflection on the visualisation process, and how you employed your project as a learning tool, to increase your visual literacy and acquire new, practical visualisation skills. 

Please use __minimum font size 11 and reasonable margins__ for written sections of your submission. <br /><br />

In the final submission, please include the following items (1-4) as appendices to your report. Your report and all appendices __must be submitted as a single file__. 

<a name = "appendices"></a>

1. __Implementation__
    * one of the following, set up to use your intended delivery method (or as close to this as you can simulate):
        * a link to a website or other online space containing your solution (ensure this works in any modern, standard web browser)
        * a single file (ideally as PDF or other non-editable format) containing of a static solution, e.g., as a report, slideshow, mini booklet, data comic, infographic or any other format that demonstrates your solution
    
    __NOTE__ do NOT submit your project as a collection of files, collate any such into a single file or site as above

1. __Snapshots &ndash; Overview + Detail__
    * 3-5 annotated snapshots showing key elements (each must fit on one side of A4)
    * 1st snapshot must show the overview or start page of your visualisation
    * the remaining snapshots (up to 4) should show one of:
        1. a sequence illustrating how a user would step through your solution
        1. detail, by drilling down from the overview, for one or two selected elements in your “story”, what you want to communicate to your target user(s)

    * you may, especially if you have an interactive or a relatively complex solution, record a video (up to 90s) giving an overview of your solution.

1. __Data__ 
    * description of your data and source/owner
        * metadata or other simple description of data content and structure (e.g., "_csv file containing 100 lines with 5 columns describing age, height ..., linked to secondary source ..._")
    * summary of the data exploration and pre-processing phase
        * how you moved from source to the version you fed into your visualisation
        * provide data snapshots to illustrate source to post processing (e.g., first, or random, three lines of a csv file highlighting key attributes/columns)
            * NOTE: mask/anonymise snapshot if necessary
        * list tool(s) used, using the tool matrix

1. __Journal__
    * documenting the process you followed
    * you decide how to present this, but it should show, e.g., "...initial brief delivered, update to brief based on EDA, change in dataset due to X..."
    * more detail if needed on your plan for future work

### Report Presentation

* __Report length__
    * __no more than 500 words, and must fit on a single side of A4 paper__
      * keep descriptions brief and to the point; ideally, use bullet points

    * each appendix that mirrors an assignment must conform to the submission instructions for the assignment in which it was specified 
    * each appendix must be referenced within the main report

* __Report Content__
    * your big question / challenge - one sentence or a couple of bullet points 
    * your (key/primary) target users (and environment if applicable)
      * _this should forward reference also to an appendix containing the final version of your brief_    

   * annotated design sketches
        * highlight which ideas you kept, which you rejected, and why. Justify your decisions using concepts from the lectures, any additional research and feedback from 
      * _this should forward reference also to an appendix containing the final version of your design_     
      
    * EDA and its impact on your plan
    
    * impact of tool exploration and review, critical analysis, peer feedback and formal evaluation plan on original brief and initial design  
      * _this should forward reference also to two appendices containing:_
         * the final version of your annotated tool matrix, showing between 3 and 5 tools that link back to your goals
         * your formal evaluation plan, and a summary of any initial results/feedback &ndash; from target end users and/or your peers if you took part in the tutorial on evaluation. 
      
    * overall, reflect on the new skills you gained (techniques, tools, process) and how these fed into your delivery; you may present this as a comparison of your initial learning goals against the skills you actually gained
    * summary of future plan, indicating extensibility and reusability, and taking into account practical constraints
         * if needed provide further detail as part of journal 

    * __Acknowledge all people, organisations (e.g., data owners, end users) and data sources that fed into your work__

<p>&nbsp;</p>

* __In writing your report, reflect on:__

    * the process you followed
        * how a focus on visualisation as a tool for thinking, exploration and presentation impacted your workflow and outcomes
    * how you chose to communicate your ideas through the design process
    * the insights you discovered through EDA, any challenges you encountered and steps you took to resolve those
    * what you will take away from this course and what you would do differently if you repeated it or took a similar course
