# Tutorials

**Please remember that while strongly encouraged, participation in tutorials and all other interactive sessions are OPTIONAL**.  
Please note the following guidelines, which take into account feedback from interaction with participants and the constraints inherent to a virtual classroom. Please note also you **MUST** submit all assignments whether you attend tutorials or not. 
<p>&nbsp;</p>


## General Guidelines

1. Tutorials will **start on time**. Please sign in ~5min in advance to minimise disruption to the rest of the class. Most sessions will start with a brief central classroom discussion, Q&A and/or prep for the session's activities.
    - There will be a tutor in the room at least 10min before start, this is a good time to double check technical requirements,  ask any questions specific to the session's structure or highlight special adjustments you may need for the session. 
    - Especially because we can only partially simulate a physical classroom, it is also perfectly fine during this period to use the chat functionality to catch up or chat informally with tutors and other participants.
1. We ask that you remain within the session (A or B) you select at the start of the course. However, if your personal circumstances impact your attendance please speak to a course tutor about switching to a different schedule.
1. Most activities will have a combination of group and individual work. Most group work will have participants assigned to specific groups, mainly to ensure relatively even distribution of domain/sector or technical experience across groups. To support exchange of ideas and perspectives, as well as networking, group membership will change across tutorials.
    - Note that group activities will be set up to ensure private or otherwise sensitive data and interests are not shared.
    - If you have special requirements that necessitate moving from a specified group please speak to a course tutor in the first instance.
1. With the exception of individual project work, activities carried out during tutorials will shared via Teams and/or SharePoint to facilitate wider discussion and reflection on learning. Each tutorial script will include instructions on access to the session's space. 
    - Note that access to the shared space will be restricted to participants on the course. You will normally be given access through your university account.
1. Some activities are marked as optional; these are additional exercises to reinforce knowledge in other sessions. You may try these out on your own. 
1. Please note the scripts for each tutorial are a guide to each session only; interactive sessions will for the most part adopt a *flipped classroom* approach, and focus on discussion adapted to the class's needs, without detracting from the key learning requirements set.

### Virtual classroom &amp; resources
* We will use the [MS Teams](https://bit.ly/dv4p2022) environment for all interactive sessions. You will receive by e-mail (to your university address) an access link. Tools included:
    - whiteboard 
    - slideshow
    - file sharing
    - chat (will remain available throughout course).
