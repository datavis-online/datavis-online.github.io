### Tutorial1-1c: Basic Charts

* This is an add-on exercise you may wish to try in your own time. We will cover similar exercises as part of other tutorials as the course progresses.
* The exercise uses data from National Records Scotland's 2019 population estimates<sup>[1](#ref-nrs-2019pop_estimates)</sup> and the time series<sup>[2](#ref-nrs-2019time_series)</sup> data.

1. Activity 1 (15min)
    * ***On your own or with a group***
    * Sketch (free-hand) up to 3 chart types for the datasets to show how you would use the data to illustrate:
        1. population change over the last century
        1. population distribution by age and/or sex in 2019
        1. population change by age group over the last 10 years
        1. the top and bottom 10% in population change by council area over the last year
        
1. Discussion (15min)
    * ***In the main classroom***
    * Discuss ideas (if on your own you may find it useful to reflect on these points)
        - Who is your target user? What influence did this have?
        - simple vs complex visualisations
        - coupled visualisations
