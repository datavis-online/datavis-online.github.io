# Topics & Schedule 

The course is expected to require a total __time investment of 5-10h / week__, roughly split into

* 1h video material (at own pace)
* 1h reading (optional)
* 2h tutorial (optional)
* 1h Q&A sessions (optional)
* 1-3h individual project work

## The course features 

* Recorded __video lectures__, mostly organised into bite-sized chunks of _5-10min_, with a few longer videos 20-25min, which can be watched at one's own pace. 
* __Reading materials__ in the form of text book chapters and (easy to understand) scientific papers, associated with topics and lectures.  
* Tested your lecture knowledge in __quizzes__ 
* Questions about topics will be discussed in general __Q&A sessions__, once a week. 
* __2h live tutorials:__ While not compulsory, participants are encouraged to take full advantage of these sessions to engage in discussions with peers and invited subject matter and domain experts, and to obtain direct feedback on assignments. 
  * design and critiquing exercises, as well as
  * for a selection of free, open source and commercial data visualisation and visual analytics tools, to demonstrate the range of features available, skills required and user support, for deriving insight into data through visual exploration and analysis. 
* __1-1 sessions__ to help with data visualisation briefs, ideally using participants’ own data, create a design to meet the requirements identified, and, within the constraints of the course, build a visualisation-driven solution.
* A __Teams channel__ will support networking and discussions.
* A __[dedicated forum](https://github.com/datavis-online/datavis-online.github.io/discussions)__ to discuss questions among the participants. 

# Schedule Overview

Each week will focus on one key topic:

* __Weeks 1 to 3__ focus on __mandatory topics__ to provide a general understanding of the main concepts in data visualisation design.  
* __Weeks 4 &amp; 5__ focus on __visualisation techniques__ for specific data types as relational data, temporal data, geographical, etc.
* __Weeks 6 __ looks at techniques for __storytelling with data__
* __Week 7__ discusses evaluation strategies for your visualization 
* __Week 8__ is not a taught week. It's to finish your projects which you have to hand in at the end of that week.

# Detailed Schedule

## Week 1: Introduction and Foundations

Introduction into basics of data visualization. *Why are we using data visualization? Why does visualization work? What are forms of visualization? What is the difference between exploration and explanation. What is of visualization literacy?* The week's second session introduces the visualizaton design process, basics of design thinking, and understand the idea behind Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).

The week will see a sketching exercise, and **tutorial on basic charts and common flaws in visualizations**. You will formulate a **visualization challenge** for your class project.  

## Week 2: Visualization Design

Basic concepts of visualization design: data types, visual variables, color, design guidelines. 

You will engage in **sketching and ideation** for your class project. 

## Week 3: Visualization Tools 

This lecture overviews and introduces common software applications (tools) to help with both: data analysis and the creation of visualizations. We will overview tools for programming environments such as python (e.g., Seaborn) and JavaScript (e.g., D3), but also tools using common user interfaces (e.g., Rawgraph, Datawrapper). The lecture will not teach how to use these tools, but focus on a high-level overview of the many different tools and workflows exist to create data visualizations.

The tutorial will **discuss visualization tools** with us and the peers. We also run a **sneak-preview tutorial on D3**.

## Week 4: Visualization Techniques I 

Choose between a selection of lectures and readings on 
* Basic Charts
* Multidimensional data
* Geographic data


You will work on **preparing and exploring your data** for your class project. 
## Week 5: Visualization Techniques II 

Choose between a selection of lectures and readings on 
* Networks
* Trees + Hierarchies
* Temporal Data

You will engage in **critical analysis** of your class project progress. 

## Week 6: Storytelling

This lecture focuses on effective presentation and communication techniques when using visualizations in e.g., infographics and presentations. Other presentation media can include videos, posters, or data comics. The lecture investigates how presenting and talking with visualizations is different than using visualizations for exploring and analyzing data.

In the tutorial, you will have the chance to **work on a storyboard** for the story you want to tell with your data.

## Week 7: Evaluation

This lecture covers techniques to assess if a given visualization technique (existing or your own creation) is “successful”. Successful is a broad term and refers to both effectiveness and efficiency in which a user or audience are supported in their analysis or understanding of the data. The lecture proposes a simple heuristic, Readability, Understandability, Supportiveness, Truthfulness, Insightfulness and Communication

## Week 8

You can use this week to finalize your project and request more 1-1s with the course organizers.
