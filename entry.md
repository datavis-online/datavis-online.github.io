# Fees and Funding

The *Scottish Funding Council (SFC) Upskilling Fund* provides a __fixed number of fee waivers__ for participants who meet at least one of several select criteria. You may be eligible for funding if you meet at least one of the following:

* you have been living in Scotland for the last three years for reasons other than education.
* you are an EU citizen living in the EU.
* you live in the rest of the UK but work for a Scottish employer (an employer which is based in or has a significant presence in Scotland).
* PhD students, RAs, and other academic staff at a Scottish or EU university (**not** including the rest of the UK). 
 
You will *not* qualify for fee waivers if __any__ of the following applies:
* you live in England, Wales, or Northern Ireland without ties to a Scottish employer.
* you live anywhere in the world (outside Scotland and EU) without ties to a Scottish employer.
* you have been living in Scotland for less than 3 years for work purposes.
* you are a full-time student (including full-time PhD students) currently enrolled in a Scottish university

If you do not qualify for the SFC funding you may still qualify for funding under the new [*National Transition Training Fund*](https://www.myworldofwork.co.uk/national-transition-training-fund).  

The __course fee is Â£960__. While those who obtain fee waivers will be prioritised in allocating places, we do have availability for fee-paying participants, both within and outwith Scotland.
