# Fees and Funding

The *Scottish Funding Council (SFC) Upskilling Fund* is providing a __fixed number of fee waivers__ for participants who meet at least one of the following criteria. 

You qualify for the fee waivers if __one__ the following is true:

* anyone living in Scotland for the last three years for reasons other than education, 
* any EU citizen living in the EU
* anyone living in the rest of the UK and working for a Scottish employer (an employer which is based in or has a significant presence in Scotland).
* PhD students, RAs, and other academic staff at a Scottish or EU university (not including the rest of the UK). 
 
You do *not* qualify for fee waivers if __any__ of the following applies:
