### Learning Outcomes
1. **Analyse:** Describe a challenge for a visualisation project and the reasons why visualisation is required. 
2. **Structure:** Break down the project with consideration for its context (target audience, usage scenario), potential tasks that the visualisation should facilitate, and the characteristics of the data set.
3. **Design+Implement:** Create a visualisation through one of various media (website, interactive, infographic, etc.) and through a self-selected set of tools (e.g., Tableau, D3.js), to match the earlier-identified challenge.
4. **Evaluation:** Critically reflect on a visualisation design and suggest constructive solutions. 
5. **Apply:** Competently apply a wide range of visualisation techniques and tools, informed by their particular features and drawbacks.

## Takeaways 
* A **certificate** to reflect a 10 credit-bearing course at Masters level (SCQF Level 11)
* **Visual representation** of your dataset that enables you to answer the challenge you defined around it before and during the course.
* **Skills** to develop further visual literacy to support data-driven work.
